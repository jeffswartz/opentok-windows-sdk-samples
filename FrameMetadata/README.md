FrameMetadata
=============

FrameMetadata builds on the BasicVideoChat sample application, adding frame metadata to
streams. This sample is intentionally simple, adding a date timestamp as the frame metadata.
You can set frame metadata to provide more relevant frame-related data to streams in your
application.

See the [Basic tutorial at the OpenTok developer
center](https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/windows/basic-video-chat/) for a description
of how to connect to an OpenTok session and how to publish and subscribe to streams in a session.

*Important:* To use this application, follow the instructions in the
[Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) section of the main README file for this repository.
